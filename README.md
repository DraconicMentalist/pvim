# Portable-vim

## installation

pvim, AKA seanvim, is an AllInOne-directory Neovim wrapper.

To install it alongside my config use:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RoryNesbitt/pvim
```

To use your own config run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RoryNesbitt/pvim
git clone <YOURCONFIG> pvim/config
```

## ToDo

- [ ] Check the commands actually work
- [x] Thank the neovim matrix guys
- [ ] improve the README
- [ ] improve the update-command to update your config as well as the appimage
